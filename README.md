Setup
-----

You need nDistro setup which is outlined here: http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/864064044/ndistro-node-distribution-toolkit

You then can run 'ndistro' on the command line and it will setup local instances of NodeJS, ExpressJS and Connect which are all required for this project.

Running
-------

Run in the command line by typing:

  ./bin/node app.js

Things to do
------------

* persist data (was thinking of writing to file on a setTimeout function)
